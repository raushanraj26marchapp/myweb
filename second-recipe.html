            <h2>Pizza</h2>
            <p>(Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
            flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, 
            and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
            which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. 
            A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

                Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. 
                Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.
                At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. 
                A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. 
                A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.
                Cover the dough with plastic wrap. 
                For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.

                Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza base when the dough is ready. 
                Dust the space a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a rolling pin,
                roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is even at all ends.) 
                Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. 
                Put it into the preheated oven and bake it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is ready.

                Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, 
                peel the onions and cut thin slices of it as well in another bowl. And finally, 
                cut tomatoes and mushrooms in the same manner. However, make sure that those tomatoes have less juice in them. 
                Once all the veggies are done, Now, grate the processed and mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.
                Then, take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all over. 
                Spread half the processed cheese all over the base and evenly put the veggies all across the base. 
                Once you have put all the veggies, put a thick layer of mozzarella cheese.
